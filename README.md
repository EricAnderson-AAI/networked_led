# Networked LEDs

This project demonstrates how to connect to a Raspberry Pi via Wifi and use a General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pin to turn an LED on and off.

** This has only been tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

## Getting Started

Set the following environment variables first:

  * `MIX_TARGET` (Example: "rpi3")
  * `NERVES_NETWORK_KEY_MGMT` (Example: "WPA2-PSK")
  * `NERVES_NETWORK_SSID` (Your network SSID)
  * `NERVES_NETWORK_PSK` (Your network PSK)

Un-comment and set the node name line in `rel/vm.args`:

  *  -name networked_light@`(Raspberry Pi IP address)`

To start your Nerves app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`

Send firmware to Raspberry Pi via wifi:

  * mix firmware.push `(Raspberry Pi IP address)` --target rpi3

## Hardware

You will need a single LED connected to GND and a GPIO pin with a 270 Î© resistor.

The default configuration uses GPIO pin 26, which can be found on a Raspberry Pi using the following diagram from https://pinout.xyz:

## Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

You can connect to the Raspberry Pi node with the following command:

  * iex --name "me@mynode" --cookie jeeplife --remsh "networked_light@(Your Raspberry Pi IP Address)"

## NetworkedLights.Server API

   * NetworkedLights.Server.led_on
